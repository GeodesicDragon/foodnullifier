# foodnullifier
A mod for RimWorld which adds a replacement stomach that eliminates a pawn's need to eat. Every 2 seconds, it will completely refill their hunger meter, though it also reduces their consciousness by 10%. Both of these can be changed in the mod options.

IMPORTANT: Requires the XML Extended mod in order to function correctly: https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2574315206
