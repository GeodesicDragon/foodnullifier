	<description><![CDATA[Adds a replacement stomach which is <i>extremely</i> expensive and requires great skill to make, but completely removes a pawn's need to eat.
	
<b>"THIS IS JUST A NUCLEAR STOMACH DONE DIFFERENTLY!"</b>

Pawns with a nuclear stomach will still get hungry, just at a slower rate; the food nullifier eliminates hunger completely, and - as an added bonus - does not carry a risk of cancer, which makes it superior to the nuclear stomach by a substantial amount.]]></description>
