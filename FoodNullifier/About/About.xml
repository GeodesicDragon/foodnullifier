	<description><![CDATA[Adds a food nullifier which is quite expensive and requires great skill to make, but will completely eliminate the need for a pawn - or animal - to eat. Should work with animals added by other mods as long as they use 'AnimalThingBase.'
	
Installing a nullifier will reduce a pawn's consciousness by 10%, though this can be disabled in the mod options.
	
<b>"THIS IS JUST A NUCLEAR STOMACH DONE DIFFERENTLY!"</b>

Pawns with a nuclear stomach will still get hungry, just at a slower rate; the food nullifier eliminates hunger completely, and - as an added bonus - does not carry a risk of cancer, which makes it superior to the nuclear stomach by a substantial amount.]]></description>
