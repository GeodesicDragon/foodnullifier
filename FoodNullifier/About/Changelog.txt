Version 1.4.39 (October 26th 2022)

* Increased hunger rate reduction to -1000% (was -200). This should hopefully prevent the Food meter from draining, and compensate for mods, items, drugs, medical conditions and so forth which can affect a pawn's hunger rate.

Version 1.4.38 (October 6th 2022)

* Mod is now compatible with the RimWorld 1.4 patch.

Version 1.4.37 (October 2nd 2022)

* Installing a nullifier now has a drawback in that it will reduce a pawn's consciousness by 10%.
	* Enabled by default; it can be turned off by going to Options > More Mod Settings > Food Nullifier.
	* If you can think of something other than consciousness for it to affect, please let me know.

Version 1.3.37 (August 24th 2022)

* Researching the nullifier no longer requires techprints.
* Increased research cost to 9600 (was 7200). Be advised that if you've completed the research already, you will need to research the remaining 2400 points before you can make nullifiers again.

Version 1.3.35 (June 25th 2022)

* The food bar no longer goes down for pawns with a nullifier who are affected by a neural supercharge and/or smokeleaf joint.
	* Thanks to Caz for bringing this issue to my attention.

Version 1.3.34 (April 23rd 2022)

* Corrected minor spelling error in research description.

Version 1.3.33 (January 27th 2022)

* Fixed 'Some descriptionHyperlinks in FoodNullifier had null def.' error.

HOLY HELL, I ACTUALLY MADE THIS UPDATE IN SEPTEMBER 2021; HOW THE HELL DID I FORGET ABOUT IT?! D:

Version 1.3.32 (September 19th 2021)

* You should now be able to install a food nullifier in all animals, even those added by other mods, as long as said animal uses 'AnimalThingBase.'
	* This patch was made possible by the XML Extensions mod, which is now required in order to use this one.
	* Thanks to BBLKepling from the RimWorld Discord server for providing the patch I needed.
* Intellectual skill is no longer required in order to craft nullifiers, though a crafting skill of 15 is still necessary.
* Installed nullifiers now show hunger rate offset as -100% instead of -1000000% or whatever it was before.
* For real this time, techprints should now be available from outlander factions (both civil and rough).

Version 1.2.29 (August 21st 2021)

* Techprints should now be available from outlander factions (both civil and rough).
* Making a nullifier now requires 50 gold as originally intended, instead of 500.

Version 1.2.26 (July 11th 2021)

* Mod is now compatible with the RimWorld 1.3 patch.

Version 1.2.25 (January 23rd 2021)

* Food nullifiers no longer react to EMPs.
* Food nullifiers now require 50 gold to make, instead of 300 steel.
* Reduced the plasteel cost of a food nullifier to 90 (was 300).
* Reduced the advanced component cost of a food nullifier to 2 (was 5).
* Reduced the Intellectual skill needed to make a food nullifier to 12 (was 15).

AUTHOR'S NOTE: Changing the resource cost of a nullifier brings it more in line with the cost of a bionic stomach, which only costs 10 plasteel and 3 advanced components to make; making a food nullifier will now cost a total of 100 plasteel, 50 gold and 5 advanced components.

Version 1.2.20 (November 13th 2020)

* Learning how to craft food nullifiers now requires you to research them first.
	* The 'Food nullifier tech' requires Bionic replacements, one techprint, a hi-tech research bench and a multi-analyser.
	* It is classed as Spacer tech with a base cost of 7200.
	* Techprints have a default market value of 4500 silver.
* Reduced the steel cost of a food nullifier to 300 (was 500).
* Reduced the plasteel cost of a food nullifier to 300 (was 500).
* Reduced the advanced component cost of a food nullifier to 5 (was 10).
* A bionic stomach is now required to craft a food nullifier.
	* Author's Note: Since the nullifier is essentially a replacement stomach, it makes sense to require a bionic one to craft it.
* Increased slowdown caused by EMP damage to 75% (was 50%).
* EMP damage now lasts anywhere between 3000-6000 ticks (was 3500-5000).

Version 1.1.14 (September 10th 2020)

* Food nullifiers can now be installed in animals.
	* This only applies to animals in the base game; modded animals are not covered.

Version 1.0.14 (August 21st 2020)

* Mod is now compatible with the RimWorld 1.2 patch.
* Pawns with a nullifer installed will no longer vomit when they are hit by an EMP.
	* Instead, the implant will malfunction for a while, causing pain in the user (Wimpy pawns beware) and slowing them down.

Version 1.0.12 (June 12th 2020)

* Increased market value of the nullifier to 10,000 silver (was 5,000).
* Meals are no longer required to make a nullifier.
* Increased steel and plasteel cost to 500 of each (was 300).
* Lowered the Medical skill required to install a nullifier to 12 (was 15).

Version 1.0.8 (June 5th 2020)

* Food nullifier now requires a Medical skill of at least 15 to install.
* Food nullifier now requires a Crafting skill of at least 15 to make (was 12).
* Food nullifier now requires an Intellectual skill of at least 15 to make (was 12).

Version 1.0.5 (June 4th 2020)

- No longer requires Royalty DLC.
	- Requires 'Bionics' research.
	- I disabled every other mod I have installed and enabled the 'Simulate not owning Royalty' option. When the game restarted, I didn't get any errors related to this mod, so that tells me it no longer uses Royalty content. I also started a new colony just to be even surer; again, no errors were reported.
- Food nullifier now has a market value of 5,000 silver.
- Food nullifier now has a mass of 3.
- Food nullifier now has a maximum of 100HP.

Version 1.0.1 (June 4th 2020)

- Initial Release.
