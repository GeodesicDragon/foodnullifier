Version 1.0.5 (June 4th 2020)

- No longer requires Royalty DLC.
	- Requires 'Bionics' research.
	- I disabled every other mod I have installed and enabled the 'Simulate not owning Royalty' option. When the game restarted, I didn't get any errors related to this mod, so that tells me it no longer uses Royalty content. I also started a new colony just to be even surer; again, no errors were reported.
- Food nullifier now has a market value of 5,000 silver.
- Food nullifier now has a mass of 3.
- Food nullifier now has a maximum of 100HP.
