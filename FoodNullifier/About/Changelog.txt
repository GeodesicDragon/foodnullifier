Version 1.2.29 (August 21st 2021)

* Techprints should now be available from outlander factions (both civil and rough).
* Making a nullifier now requires 50 gold as originally intended, instead of 500.

Version 1.2.26 (July 11th 2021)

* Mod is now compatible with the RimWorld 1.3 patch.

Version 1.2.25 (January 23rd 2021)

* Food nullifiers no longer react to EMPs.
* Food nullifiers now require 50 gold to make, instead of 300 steel.
* Reduced the plasteel cost of a food nullifier to 90 (was 300).
* Reduced the advanced component cost of a food nullifier to 2 (was 5).
* Reduced the Intellectual skill needed to make a food nullifier to 12 (was 15).

AUTHOR'S NOTE: Changing the resource cost of a nullifier brings it more in line with the cost of a bionic stomach, which only costs 10 plasteel and 3 advanced components to make; making a food nullifier will now cost a total of 100 plasteel, 50 gold and 5 advanced components.

Version 1.2.20 (November 13th 2020)

* Learning how to craft food nullifiers now requires you to research them first.
	* The 'Food nullifier tech' requires Bionic replacements, one techprint, a hi-tech research bench and a multi-analyser.
	* It is classed as Spacer tech with a base cost of 7200.
	* Techprints have a default market value of 4500 silver.
* Reduced the steel cost of a food nullifier to 300 (was 500).

* Reduced the advanced component cost of a food nullifier to 5 (was 10).
* A bionic stomach is now required to craft a food nullifier.
	* Author's Note: Since the nullifier is essentially a replacement stomach, it makes sense to require a bionic one to craft it.
* Increased slowdown caused by EMP damage to 75% (was 50%).
* EMP damage now lasts anywhere between 3000-6000 ticks (was 3500-5000).

Version 1.0.5 (June 4th 2020)

- No longer requires Royalty DLC.
	- Requires 'Bionics' research.
	- I disabled every other mod I have installed and enabled the 'Simulate not owning Royalty' option. When the game restarted, I didn't get any errors related to this mod, so that tells me it no longer uses Royalty content. I also started a new colony just to be even surer; again, no errors were reported.
- Food nullifier now has a market value of 5,000 silver.
- Food nullifier now has a mass of 3.
- Food nullifier now has a maximum of 100HP.
